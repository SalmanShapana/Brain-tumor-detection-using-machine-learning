# Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model for detecting brain tumors in medical images. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains MRI images of the brain that have been labeled as either having a tumor or not having a tumor.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

5. The program will output the accuracy and other performance metrics of the machine learning model.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using the Keras library. The model is trained on MRI images of the brain and uses various layers, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers, to learn features and classify images as having a tumor or not.

## Future Improvements

1. Use a larger dataset to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model.
2. Implement a web interface for the machine learning model to enable doctors and medical professionals to use it easily.
3. Add support for other medical image formats, such as CT scans and X-rays.
